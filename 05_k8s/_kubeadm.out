Your Kubernetes control-plane has initialized successfully!

To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

  mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
  https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

Then you can join any number of worker nodes by running the following on each as root:

kubeadm join 10.1.16.71:6443 --token 5yls5b.fqaq86y457mynsfq \
    --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:2207d0aef996bf70271628ceae72e51786debeb1a49870b73bb9a3b89917ba5d 
[root@node71 ~]# kubectl
